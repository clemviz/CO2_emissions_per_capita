# How CO2 Emissions per Person have changed across Countries (1900-2023)

This visualisation shows the evolution of per capita CO₂ emissions across various countries over the last century, highlighting key trends and differences. It helps understand how different regions have contributed to carbon emissions on a per-person basis.

## Data Source
The data is sourced from **Our World in Data**:

- Global Carbon Budget (2024)
- Population estimates from various sources (2024)
- Processed and compiled by Our World in Data
